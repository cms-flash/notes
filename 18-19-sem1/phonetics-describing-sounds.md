# Phonetics: Describing Sounds

# Acoustic Phonetics

- Resonance??

- Spectra:

  - A spectrum graphs the energy concentration against frequencies.

  - A spectrum is informative when it describes a steady period.

  - The n-th formant of a spectrum is its n-th least frequent peak, denoted as Fn.

  - A spectrogram graphs the spectrum against time.

- Spectral features of vowels:

  - F1 decreases with increasing vowel height.

  - F2/F1 decreases with increasing vowel backness.

# Sociophonetics

- Phonetics of a language is inherently variable.

- Types of phonetic variations:

  - Random;

  - Idiosyncratic;

  - Social.

- Common social factors in phonetics variations:

  - Location;

  - Register;

  - Class;

  - Ethnicity;

  - Gender.

- Sociophonetic variations:

  - Segmental:

    - Vowel:

      - Shifts;

      - Diphthongization and monophthongization;

    - Consonantal:

      - Voicing and devoicing;

      - Frication;

      - Removals;

  - Suprasegmental:

    - Tonal;

    - Intonational;

    - Stressing.

- Sociophonetic variables of English:

  - Rhoticity;

  - Cot-caught merger;

  - Pin-pen merger.
