# Sex and Intimacy in Modern Times

# History of Sexuality in China and the West

- The western history of sexuality:

  - Depiction and worship of sexual organs date back to the pre-historic era.

  - The Hebrews, guided by their Bible, valued reproduction. They viewed it as the only legitimate purpose of sexuality, banning sexual conducts for any other purpose.

  - The Ancient Greeks are much more open about sex. The male and the female are idealized, with a clear gap in between. Platonic, or spiritual sex, was appreciated, especially that between men.

  - The Romans viewed sex as conquest. Women were viewed as properties of men.

  - Christianity viewed the love of God as the highest form of love, thus discouraged love of all other forms, leading to appreciation of celibacy and chastity. It embedded sin, guilt, and shame to sex.

  - During the Renaissance, human nature was promoted, with sexuality of all sorts as a part of it.

  - During the Enlightenment, science and rationality were valued, shaping the way sexuality was viewed. Notions of sexual normality and deviance were developed.

  - During the Victorian era, the public atmosphere turned conservative about sex, tying sexual behaviors to morality. But sexuality was prosperous outside public exposure. The western view of sex in the era had great impact to Hong Kong.

- The Chinese history of sexuality:

  - Confucianism valued order and the relationship between self and society, in which its view of sexuality was framed. But in its classical form, sexuality was not sinned or prohibited, if without violation of social order.

  - Taoism promoted sex as a natural way to achieve the interaction and balance between Yin and Yang.

  - Buddhism promoted suppression of all desires, including sex.

  - Neo-Confucianism, as developed in the era from Song to Ming, associated sex with sin, and strongly opposed non-reproductive sex.

  - The republican China diverged greatly from the traditional track of views of sexuality, adopting a more scientific and western stance.

# Urban Spaces of Desire

- The city, together with its anonymity, activeness, interpersonal mingling, and sheer population, enables more liberating forms of sexuality.

- The destruction of the religious, moral, and social forces constraining peopleâ€™s pursuit of different sexualities gave rise to the formal legislation and modern regulations on sexuality, in a modern industrial urban society.

- The embracing of different forms of intimacy can be a tourist attraction.

- Hong Kong, due to its lack of space, especially lacks urban spaces of desire. Many people live with their family, which greatly constraints private and intimate spaces.

# Intimate Story Telling

- Producers have experiences and convert them into stories which reach consumers, with the entire process interacting with the social environment.

- Everyone in a contemporary society is a producer and a consumer of intimate stories.

- The decision in to or not to tell an intimate story and the way to present it reflects the deep interaction between the teller and society.

# Sex Work

- There are a wide variety of sex works, from prostitution, to stripping, to compensated dating.

- New forms of sex or intimacy-related activities, such as extended compensated dating, are continuing to blur the line between real and counterfeit intimacy.

- Sex work is not the only occupation that uses erotic capital. Actors/actresses, flight attendants, and secretaries etc. all use such capital in one way or another.

- Sex workers face a variety of dangers, including health-related, physical, legal, and psychological ones.

- Successful sex workers use a set of skills to manage their emotional and identity costs in performing their work, including renaming, hiding, neutralization, distancing, and boundary setting. 

# Medicalization of Intimacy

- Classical medicalization of intimacy:

  - Women are confined and dependent on men, with their moral deviations medicalized as diseases, mostly notably hysteria, to avoid moral defamation.

  - Children are assumed and taught to be sexless, with deviations medicalized as diseases.

  - Couples are assumed to be procreative, with deviations medicalized.

  - Perverse sexual desires are psychiartized.

- Medicalization of intimacy in modern times:

  - It is assumed that there is a universal standard of beauty that everyone should pursue.

  - The ideal woman has a slim body, big eyes, a straight nose, full lips, fair skin etc.

  - The ideal man has muscles, a good hairstyle, large penis etc.

  - A perfect or ideal body is a disciplined and docile body, that is created through constant self-surveillance under the imagined social surveillance.

- We constantly alter our body, and it is very hard to find the borderline between a natural and an artificial body.

# Mobile Intimacy

- The mobile era:

  - Smartphones have completely reshaped the life of every modern citizen and become a central part of the contemporary lifestyle.

  - Presence is bleeding through multiple channels.

  - The phone is not only connected, but also affective and securing. 

- In the mobile era, intimacy has become increasingly mobile, social, and locative.

- The theory of publics:

  - The public refers to the collection of all people in society.

  - A public refers to a group of people that have received the same message through the same channel together. A public is created whenever a message delivery happens.

  - An intimate public refers to a public that is tightly bound and emotionally connected.

  - A social public refers to the group of people that have received the same message in society.

  - A social network is an interconnected ego-based formation that is not constructed through common affect.

- Mobile apps provide not only a platform for social and intimate interactions, but also standard or default patterns of such interactions.
